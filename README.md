These are a collection of scripts for various ongoing projects at the Quantitative Analysis Center and Scientific Computing and Informatics Center at Wesleyan University.

Twitter Project
---------------

The Twitter Project began streaming Tweets for all members of the House and Senate in July 2013. These are some of the
barebones scripts used for processing the data.

The 'qacprojects' folder contains a number of scripts used in visualizations that can be found on our sandbox site (qacprojects.wesleyan.edu)

----------------
Code for additional projects is to be added in the coming month.
