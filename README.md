These are a collection of scripts for various ongoing projects at the Quantitative Analysis Center at Wesleyan University.

Twitter Project
---------------

The Twitter Project began streaming Tweets for all members of the House and Senate in July 2013. These are some of the
barebones scripts used for processing the data. We will soon include scripts for visualizations and so on (see qacprojects.wesleyan.edu).

----------------
Code for additional projects is to be added in the coming month.
